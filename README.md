Betapoint
</div>
Betapoint is an open-source movement-oriented fast-paced first person shooter written in Godot. (phew) It is based on [this FPS template made by Shidoengie](https://github.com/Shidoengie/FPS-template-gd4), and aims to be a mashup of references from other games, adding them as playable characters and using their movesets. These references can be found in REFERENCES.md.

Anyone can contribute to the project, even just allowing your assets to be used (as described in REFERENCES.md) is enough to help out.

Major milestones are described in MILESTONES.md.
