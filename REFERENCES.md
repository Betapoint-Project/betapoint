Betapoint // References
</div>
Betapoint's goal to be a reference packed FPS requires keeping track of who and what we aim to add to the game. References can include things like assets, characters and items. **These references must be authorized for use in Betapoint.** Inserting references without obtaining the proper permissions from their owners could lead to legal repercussions for the project, and we would like to avoid this.

The format for this document is as shown:
```
[x] REFERENCE - OWNER (LINK TO PROOF OF USE OF THE REFERENCE BEING AUTHORIZED BY THE OWNER)
```

References that we are in the process of obtaining permission to use can be added by unchecking the checkbox and putting `(aquiring)` in the proof field.
For example:
[] The Heavy - Valve Software (acquiring)
When permission is acquired:
[x] The Heavy - Valve Software ([Permitted by owner](link://to/proof))
